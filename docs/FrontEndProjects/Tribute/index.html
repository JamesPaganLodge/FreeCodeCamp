        <p>Otter Hole is situated on the banks of the River Wye. It was discovered in the mid-70s and is considered by 
          some to be the prettiest cave in the UK.</p> 
        <p>Access to the cave is through a locked gate at the foot of a small cliff. Once inside the route takes you 
          through low, wet and muddy passages until you eventually reach sump 1. Once the sump opens with low tide 
          the cave follows the stream through a couple of boulder chokes until sump 2 is reached. Just before sump 2 
          a route heads of to the side and up to a dry fossil series which contains the formations the cave is famous 
          for.</p>
        <p>Access for indivduals and groups is controlled by the 3 local caving clubs to prevent accidental access to 
          the cave. This helps stop people getting in to difficulties with the variable tides and protect the formations 
          within the cave.</p>
