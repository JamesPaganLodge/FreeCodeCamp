        <article>
          <p>Openedge ABL is known as a 4GL language which has supposedly built upon the functionality of 3GL languages. The purpose of the 
            4GL languages was to open up the power of programming to non-developers to enable them to write reports and update databases. Openedge 
            both a database query language and a programming language. Originally Openedge ABL could only be written procedurally, but for the last
            couple of version object-orientation has been introduced, although not adopted everywhere due to large legacy code bases.</p>
          <p>Other 4GL languages:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>PowerBuilder</li>
            <li>Oracle Application Development Framework</li>
            <li>Clarion</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Openedge is currently on version 11.7.4 with version 12 set to be released in Q4 2018. Version 12 will finally bring multi-threading
            to the language</p>

        <article>
          <p>To output the text "Hello World!" copy the following into the Openedge Editor:</p>
          <code>message "Hello World!" view-as alert-box.</code>
          <p>This should pop up an alert box on the screen.</p>

        <header>Basic Variable Types</header>
        <article>
          <p>Variables can be declared as the following basic types:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>character - a character string</li>
            <li>integer - a number</li>
            <li>logical - a boolean, can be true, false and ? (kind of like null, but called the unknown value)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The syntax to declare a variable is as follows:</p>
          <code>define variable iNumber as integer no-undo.</code>
          <p>Openedge ABL uses the . (dot/fullstop) to complete statements unlike javascript and C# that use a ; (semi-colon).</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Procedures_and_Functions">
        <header>Procedures and Functions</header>
        <article>
          <p>Procedural Openedge files end in a '.p' file extension and can include user defined procedures and functions. Or it
            doesn't need to and the whole file can be one procedure that is executed from top to bottom.</p>
          <h3>Procedures</h3>
          <code>
            procedure "procedure-name":
              define input parameter cInput1 as character no-undo.
              define output parameter lOutput as logical no-undo.

            end procedure.
          </code>
          <p>The above sytanx is used to declare a new procedure in a '.p' file. These can be declared anywhere and referenced from the same
            file using <code>run procedure-name.</code>.
          </p>

          <h3>Functions</h3>
          <code>
            function fDoSomething returns logical () forward.

            // other code in file

            function fDoSomething returns logical():
              // do some processing

              return true.
            end function.
          </code>
          <p>Functions need to be declared before they can be used, hence the forward declaraction and the function implementation. For ease of code
            organisation the forward declaraction can be put at the top of the file and the function implementation can be put anywhere else in the
            file. Functions can be called during variable assignment <code>assign lResponse = fDoSomething().</code>.
          </p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Comments">
        <header>Comments</header>
        <article>
          <code>
            /* 
              Multi-line
              Comment
            */

            // Single-line comment
          </code>
          <p>Until v11.7 Openedge only supported the multi-line comment syntax. Now it supports single-line comments too!</p>
